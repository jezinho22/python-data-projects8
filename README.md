## A colection of early data work

All inspired by curiosity, really, and interests.
**EPL-history** is about who has won the top division over the years, how many times, what positions in the league. It ended up with trying to answer the question - which team has been the most successful in English league history
**korfball** is about accessing the league data for my children's team and seeing how their averages etc stack up
**NCFC-scores** is about denial, really - could City really have been that bad that season? And yes they were
**Stadium-project** is wondering about whether it's true that the bigger the stadium the more successful the team - it answers that. But not the tortology. Like is it the more successful the team the bigger the stadium they can build?
**horoscopes-project** is practising web-scraping, with a vague aim of analysing the language of horoscopes across several producers, to see what words are used most often - it needs to filter out the XX most common words across the English language really, but it still gives an answer
**FIFA19-project** in the very beginning I found a datafile of all the FIFA19 players, and decided to use it for data practice, and to work out which players to use in the game - it's the only project that didn't require web scraping. It ended up finding out other things than expected. For instance, I used it to work out that there were more Portuguese playing for Wolves than for some of the clubs in the Portuguese top division!
